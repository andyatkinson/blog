From 2009-2013 I created and maintained two apps in the iOS App Store, related to public transit. These apps provided train and bus schedule information for riders. After abandoning plans to turn these apps into a business, I open sourced the code. [TrainBrain](https://github.com/andyatkinson/TrainBrain) and [BusBrain](https://github.com/andyatkinson/BusBrain).

 * "New Train Brain app should ease life for light rail riders" [^1]
 * "Put down the bus schedule, pick up your phone" [^2]
 * "Beetle Fight ships Bus Brain mobile app" [^3]
