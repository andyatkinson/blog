### Blog

I write on this website which serves as a blog, primarily to get a deeper understanding of a topic. I like to try and include practical examples from my work experience or side projects.

Over the years I've learned a lot from the blog posts of other technical writers, so I also view writing a blog as a way of giving back.

Due to how quickly things change in technology, blogging about a topic helps me remember the details longer and recall the context quicker as well.

### This Week In Rails

Andy became a contributing editor ✍️ for [This Week in Rails](https://rails-weekly.ongoodbits.com/), a weekly newsletter covering changes to the Ruby on Rails framework. From 2015 to 2017, he wrote 6 issues as part of an editor rotation, delivered to over 6000 subscribers. Check out this ([blog post](/blog/2017/04/21/this-week-in-rails)) for more information.
