I attended RailsConf in Baltimore, MD this year. It was especially exciting as we had just relocated to Baltimore 2 days earlier after a long drive from Minneapolis. Apart from the great sessions, I was able to meet some great people from the Ruby community like Ryan Bates and John Nunemaker.

Sunday: Lightning talks, great.

[8 Steps to open source software development](http://oss-8steps.heroku.com) with Dr. Nic.: this was my second time seeing Dr. Nic, after the lightning talk Karaoke round Sunday night. He had good tips. We worked on a project by forking it and adding some development instructions.

 * check github issues
 * ruby toolbox
 * github gem
 * fork queue (check this and merge some forks in)
