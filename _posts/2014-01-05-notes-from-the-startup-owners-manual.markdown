The book **_The Startup Owner's Manual_** [^book] has a lot of practical tips to increase the chances of success at your startup. Here are some notes from Chapters 4 and 5 from the book.

##### Questions to ask

 * Have we identified a problem a customer wants to see solved?
 * Does our product solve this problem?
 * Do we have a viable and profitable business model?
 * Have we learned enough to go out and sell?
 * What do I want to learn? What is the simplest pass/fail test I can design to test this?

##### Concepts

 * Develop the product for the few, not the many.
 * Find the *earlyvangelists*. Earlyvangelists are willing to pay for the product. The buying process can be tested with the earlyvangelists.
 * Look for people solving the problem with a homegrown solution.
 * After developing the MVP features, delay new features until the MVP features are not attracting new customers.
 * Gather a massive and growing audience efficiently and cost-effectively.
 * Become #1 in something: product attribute, territory, distribution channel/retailer, or customer base.
 * Segment the market: age, income, or region.
 * Winners understand why customers buy.
 * [Commission Junction](http://www.cj.com/) referrals usually $12/referral.
 * [grants.gov](http://www.grants.gov/) worth investigating.
 * Provisional patents are good for 1 year and cheap relative to the 20-50k patent price.
 * On "get out of the building" (and talk to customers): Don't confuse motion with action. It takes a lot of meetings to generate a few meaningful conversations.

##### 30/10/10

General guidelines on user engagement

 * **30%** of registered users will use the service each month

 * Concurrent users seldom exceed **10%** of daily active users
